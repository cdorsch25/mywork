<title>Silverstein: For Sale</title> 
<!-- <p>This was one of my favorite poems growing, I owned many Shel Silverstein books.</p> -->
<!-- <p>I recently learned that Shel Silverstein was drafted to served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War,</p> -->
<!-- <p>and that he never anticipated he would ever write poems or make cartoons for children. He also wrote plays, performed sketches in theatre,</p> -->
<!-- <p>and wrote songs that reached the Billboard Top 100.</p> -->

One sister for sale! <br>
One sister for sale! <br>
One crying and spying young sister for sale! <br>

So who’ll start the bidding?<br>
Do I hear the dollar?<br>
A nickel?<br>
A penny?<br>
Oh, isn’t there, isn’t there, isn’t there <b>any</b><br>
One kid that will buy this old sister for sale,<br>
